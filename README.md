DNSAPI
======

Welcome to DNSAPI
-----------------

DNSAPI is a Ruby on Rails application designed to manage domain name services based on [Bind](https://www.isc.org/software/bind) with a RESTful API and using MySQL as persistent storage backend.
The project is an adaptation of [PowerDNS-on-rails](https://github.com/kennethkalmer/powerdns-on-rails) developed by
[Kenneth Kalmer](kenneth.kalmer@gmail.com) plus some features like UI, job queue and Bind specific importation script.

# Overview

The DNSAPI was designed to work with Bind in a passive way. Once you've configured the primary and slaves servers, database and executed the first importation of your records, all work is done between the application and the DB . Then all files are exported via Rsync tool to the Bind server(s) and any command is issued with Rndc utility.

# Motivations

##Security
	With multiple levels of privilege,  we can ensure that a specific user is abble to perform only specific tasks.

##Integrity
	All actions are validated to prevent bad records or other undesirable human mistakes.

##Usability
	The UI provides a simplier way to manage the service.

# Features
	RESTful architecture
	Multi-user with groups of privilege
	Asychronous and synchronous tasks modes
	Conversion and import tools
	Zone/Record Templates
	Full audit record of all changes
	Macros for easy bulk updating of domains
	Support for Bind MASTER, NATIVE & SLAVE record types
